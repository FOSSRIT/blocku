## About

Blocku is a math-based Sudoku-style puzzle game.
The player is given an answer and they have to complete the puzzle by matching the sides of the blocks together that, following the correct operator (+, -, \*, /) will give them the answer.


## How to Play

Move the blocks from around the outside into one of the squares.
There's a number at the top which signifies what the sides of each block has to equal. When every side is equal to that number, you win!

See the [Tutorials page](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activities/Blocku/Tutorials) for more guidance.


## How to Start

If using an XO, or other Sugar Labs platform, just [download the game](https://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4399/) and click on it.
